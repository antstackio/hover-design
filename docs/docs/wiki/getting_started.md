# Prerequisites

**Hover Design** is actively starting its development, and needs help from developers who can pitch in and do their part.

Hover Design is mainly made on Vanilla Extract which requires basic TypeScript Knowledge. With that we need basic knowledge in react, you should know about Props, Children and Refs.

To get started make yourself famaliar with:

- [Vanilla Extract](https://vanilla-extract.style/documentation)
- React
- Basic Typescript
- Basics of Storybook and stories, we use [Ladle](https://ladle.dev/)

We use the [recipies](https://vanilla-extract.style/documentation/recipes-api/) api heavily along with styles.

We believe in acessibility first way of developing and to ensure that we always extend HTML elements rather than using css and js to heavily modify a `<div>`

Make sure to go through [Contribution Guide](/docs/contribution) and contact [@pruthvi2103](https://github.com/pruthvi2103) or [@Raalzz](https://github.com/Raalzz) via slack for planning out components.
