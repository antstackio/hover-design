# Prerequisites

**Hover Design** is actively starting its development, and needs help from developers who can pitch in and do their part.

Hover Design is mainly made on Vanilla Extract which requires basic TypeScript Knowledge. With that we need basic knowledge in react, you should know about Props, Children and Refs.

To get started make yourself famaliar with:

- [Vanilla Extract](https://vanilla-extract.style/documentation)
- React
- Basic Typescript
- Basics of Storybook

We use the [recipies](https://vanilla-extract.style/documentation/recipes-api/) and [sprinkles](https://vanilla-extract.style/documentation/sprinkles-api/) api heavily along with styles.

Issues are coming soon but right now contact @pruthvi via slack for planning out components.
