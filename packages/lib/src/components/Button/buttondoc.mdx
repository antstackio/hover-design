# Replacing DocsPage with custom `MDX` content

This file is a documentation-only `MDX`file to customize Storybook's [DocsPage](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-docs/docs-page#replacing-docspage).

It can be further expanded with your own code snippets and include specific information related to your stories.

For example:

import { Story } from "@storybook/addon-docs";

## Button

Button is the primary component. It has four possible states.

- [Primary]`(#primary)`
- [Secondary]`(#secondary)`
- [Large]`(#large)`
- [Small]`(#small)`

## With the story title defined

If you included the title in the story's default export, use this approach.

### Primary

`<Story id="example-button--primary" />`

### Secondary

`<Story id="example-button--secondary" />`

### Large

`<Story id="example-button--large" />`

### Small

`<Story id="example-button--small" />`

## Without the story title defined

If you didn't include the title in the story's default export, use this approach.

### Primary

`<Story id="your-directory-button--primary"/>`

### Secondary

`<Story id="your-directory-button--secondary"/>`

### Large

`<Story id="your-directory-button--large"/>`

### Small

`<Story id="your-directory-button--small" />`
